# Restricted Most Powerful Bayesian Test (RMPBT)

This repository contains the code (Julia code) implementing the approach described in our JASA paper titled: Restricted Most Powerful Bayesian Test paper (see reference below). We also implement the approach described in RAPTT: An Exact Two-Sample Test in High Dimensions Using Random Projections (reference below) and other two-sample mean testing approaches.

# Usage
RMPBT.jl is a Julia Module that contains all the necessary functions


RMPBT_Test_function.jl contains a small example illustrating the performance of our proposed approach.
